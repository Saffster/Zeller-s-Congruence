# Zeller-s-Congruence
Zeller's Congruence is a method designed to find the day of the week corresponding to any given date in the Gregorian calendar. It was first discovered and proposed by Julius Christian Johannes Zeller, a German mathematician, and published in the journal of the Societe Mathematique de France. This is a Program that does that.
